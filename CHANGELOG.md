## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- One MCP server for three second-opinion backends — `codex`, `kimi` and `claude` — with the backend as a tool parameter rather than a separate server (M0–M4).
- Synchronous verbs: `amicus_consult`, `amicus_review_changes`, `amicus_delegate`, `amicus_adversarial_review`, plus free dry-run previews for review (`amicus_dry_run`) and delegate (`amicus_delegate_dry_run`).
- Discovery surface: `amicus_backends`, `amicus_capabilities`, `amicus_models`, and the MCP resources that back them.
- A jobs surface: `_async` twins of the paid verbs, `amicus_job_status`, `amicus_job_result`, `amicus_job_consume_result`, `amicus_job_list`, `amicus_job_cancel`, with idempotency keys, restart survival and task-id lookup (M2).
- `task=True` on the four paid synchronous tools behind the `AMICUS_TASKS` flag (M5).
- Packaging for both hosts: a `.claude-plugin/` manifest, a `.codex-plugin/` manifest, an `amicus-mcp` console script, and the `collaborating-with-amicus` skill (M6).
- Release automation: a tag- and dispatch-triggered publish workflow with trusted publishing to TestPyPI and PyPI.
- A release predicate gating that upload: a `verify` job runs `scripts/check_release_state.py` against the tagged commit, and `pypi` depends on it (issue #25, ADR 0014). It proves the tagged tree's release-state coherence — every version literal, the dated changelog section, `uv.lock` — and checks that the live-gate record carried in the annotated tag's message is well formed and names that commit. That record remains the maintainer's assertion, never proof the live gates ran.

### Known limitations

- The tagged publish path to pypi.org has never run. Only the TestPyPI dispatch path has been exercised.
- Eval scenario S6 in `skills/collaborating-with-amicus/tests/scenarios.md` passed on one run (status: `pass`, validated by that run alone); an M7 follow-up run against the current skill text did not isolate the still-open F3 finding, so F3 remains open. S7 (real-host approval friction) has failed both of its recorded runs (status: `fail`); an M7 zero-spend recheck reached neither a pass nor a fail and is recorded as inconclusive, so it does not move S7's status. See their `status` fields and ADR 0012.
