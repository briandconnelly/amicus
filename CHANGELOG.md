# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Both plugin manifests carry `author.url`, and their `longDescription` names
  `docs/MIGRATION.md` by absolute URL rather than by a repository-root-relative path that
  does not resolve for a consumer who vendors the manifest without the repository around it.
- `.mcp.json`'s pin now names an already-published release rather than the version being
  released, so `main` never sends a fresh install to a tag that does not exist yet
  ([ADR 0015](docs/adr/0015-mcp-json-pins-an-already-published-release.md), issue #26).
  The pin is no longer a release version literal; a small `chore(release):` PR moves it after the
  tag is pushed.
- `scripts/check_release_state.py` replaces its `pin == version being released` equality — which was
  true by construction on any tree a release PR had touched — with a shape check, a check that the
  pin never leads the release, and a check that the pinned tag actually exists.
- `docs/RELEASING.md` gains a pre-tag install rehearsal that runs the committed manifest's own
  command against the release commit's SHA, so git transport, a clean-machine build and the wire
  handshake are all exercised before anything irreversible happens.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- One MCP server for three second-opinion backends — `codex`, `kimi` and `claude` — with the backend as a tool parameter rather than a separate server (M0–M4).
- Synchronous verbs: `amicus_consult`, `amicus_review_changes`, `amicus_delegate`, `amicus_adversarial_review`, plus free dry-run previews for review (`amicus_dry_run`) and delegate (`amicus_delegate_dry_run`).
- Discovery surface: `amicus_backends`, `amicus_capabilities`, `amicus_models`, and the MCP resources that back them.
- A jobs surface: `_async` twins of the paid verbs, `amicus_job_status`, `amicus_job_result`, `amicus_job_consume_result`, `amicus_job_list`, `amicus_job_cancel`, with idempotency keys, restart survival and task-id lookup (M2).
- `task=True` on the four paid synchronous tools behind the `AMICUS_TASKS` flag (M5).
- Packaging for both hosts: a `.claude-plugin/` manifest, a `.codex-plugin/` manifest, an `amicus-mcp` console script, and the `collaborating-with-amicus` skill (M6).
- Release automation: a tag- and dispatch-triggered publish workflow with trusted publishing to TestPyPI and PyPI.
- A release predicate gating that upload: a `verify` job runs `scripts/check_release_state.py` against the tagged commit, and `pypi` depends on it (issue #25, ADR 0014). It proves the tagged tree's release-state coherence — every version literal, the dated changelog section, `uv.lock` — and checks that the live-gate record carried in the annotated tag's message is well formed and names that commit. That record remains the maintainer's assertion, never proof the live gates ran.

### Fixed

- `record_live_gate_evidence.validate` accepted a record that omitted `batch_id` from every backend entry, so the "one shared run produced this record" property it documented was not actually checkable. `batch_id` is now a required backend field.

### Known limitations

- The tagged publish path to pypi.org has never run. Only the TestPyPI dispatch path has been exercised.
- Eval scenario S6 in `skills/collaborating-with-amicus/tests/scenarios.md` passed on one run (status: `pass`, validated by that run alone); an M7 follow-up run against the current skill text did not isolate the still-open F3 finding, so F3 remains open. S7 (real-host approval friction) has failed both of its recorded runs (status: `fail`); an M7 zero-spend recheck reached neither a pass nor a fail and is recorded as inconclusive, so it does not move S7's status. See their `status` fields and ADR 0012.
